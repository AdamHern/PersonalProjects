Hi, 

My name is Adam Hernandez. I am a Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a deep interest in the implementation of Artifical Intellignce, as well as its ethical implications. 
This reprository contains some of my own personal python projects, along with a folder containing coppies of my ongoing series of essays entitled the Syntax Papers.
